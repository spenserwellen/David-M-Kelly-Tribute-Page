          David Kelley is the founder of the global design and innovation company IDEO. Kelley also founded <a href="https://engineering.stanford.edu/get-involved/give/hasso-plattner-institute-design" alt="Stanford Hasso-Plattner Institute of Design">Stanford University’s Hasso Plattner Institute of Design, known as the d.school</a>. As Stanford’s Donald W. Whittier Professor in Mechanical Engineering, Kelley is the Academic Director of both of the degree-granting undergraduate and graduate programs in Design within the School of Engineering, and has taught classes in the program for more than 35 years.
        </p><br>
        <p class="long-copy">
          Kelley’s most enduring contributions are in human-centered design methodology and design thinking. He is most passionate about using design to help unlock reative confidence in everyone from students to business executives. A frequent speaker on these topics, Kelley and his brother co-authored the New York Times best-selling book <a href="https://www.creativeconfidence.com/buy/" alt="Creative Confidence Book">Creative Confidence: Unleashing the Creative Potential Within Us All</a>.</p><br>
        <p class="long-copy">
          After earning a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, Kelley worked as an engineer at both Boeing and NCR. Drawn to design, he entered Stanford University in 1975, where he earned his master’s degree in Engineering/Product Design. In 1978, he founded the design firm that would become <a href="https://www.ideo.com" alt="IDEO Website">IDEO</a> and, in that same year, began his teaching career at Stanford, receiving tenure in 1990. He also founded an early-stage venture-capital firm in 1984 called Onset, and was instrumental in starting a special effects firm called Edge Innovations, which creates unique Animatronics for the film industry.</p><br>
        <p class="long-copy">
          Kelley was inducted into the National Academy of Engineering in 2000. He holds honorary PhD's from both the <a href="https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/" alt="Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth">Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth</a> and Art Center College in Pasadena. He has been recognized with numerous honors, including the Chrysler Design Award and the National Design Award in Product Design from the Smithsonian’s Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, the Robert Fletcher Award from Dartmouth, and the <a href="https://edisonawards.com/achievementaward.php" alt="Edison Achievement Award for Innovation">Edison Achievement Award for Innovation</a>. Preparing the design thinkers of tomorrow earned him the Sir Misha Black Medal for his “distinguished contribution to design education".</p>
